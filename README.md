- 🔭 I recently graduated with a **Master’s in Information Technology and Analytics from Rutgers University**, where I was inducted into **Beta Gamma Sigma**, the international honor society for top business students. I’m currently working as an Adjunct Lecturer at Rutgers, teaching Python, data analysis, and business research methods to undergraduate students.

I'm driven by the intersection of data, technology, and education, and I love solving real-world problems—whether it's forecasting healthcare demand or helping students write their first line of code.

  

# Professional Experience Highlights:
